# trichloride
trichrome-ish video because what [dslr-trichrome](https://github.com/eclecticnybles/gaze/tree/main/dslr-trichrome) gives me is fantastic.

This uh, will probably not work on your computer? It assumes the frames from the webcam are YUV422 because that's what my computer gives me even when it claims it's giving me a different format. I'm going to try to fix it, it just might take a second. Okay?

## Other things
As well as trichloride, the tri-chrome video thing, a few other projects live here as they're video related and some are used in trichloride itself.

### `devout`
convenient crate for outputting MP4s with H264 encoded video. It tries to keep a simple and easy to use API mostly above all else.

### `aisle51`
A thing for testing how fast `devout` can do things. Creates test video.

Named after the Aisle at my local Michaels that has all the picture frames.
