# trichloride
trichrome-ish video because what [dslr-trichrome](https://github.com/eclecticnybles/gaze/tree/main/dslr-trichrome) gives me is fantastic.

This uh, will probably not work on your computer? It assumes the frames from the webcam are YUV422 because that's what my computer gives me even when it says it claims it's giving me a different format. I'm going to try to fix it, it just might take a second. Okay?
